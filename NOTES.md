# Notes from videods:
- Jest will fail if no files match the `.test.js` suffix (files that should have test scripting) or if no instructions exist in your `.test.js` file

## Terminology:
- "Testing Runner": something that runs your tests for you. You can tell your test runner to watch all changes, or to only run once (depending on whether you need to test frequently or before final deployment ... can also speed-up your flow if you elect to test less often)
